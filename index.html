                <p>A superhero or superheroine is a stock character that possesses superpowers, abilities beyond those of ordinary people, and fits the role of the hero, typically using his or her powers to help the world become a better place, or dedicating themselves to protecting the public and fighting crime.In the featured article, Megan Margulies, granddaughter of the creator of Captain America, writes about how comic books and “magical thinking” can help children get through hard times.
                In this lesson, you will learn more about the origin of Captain America and the power of comic books to offer relief, escape and hope during difficult times. In a Going Further activity, you will create your own superhero to help kids get through the pandemic.</p>

            <h2>FRAME OF REFERENCE</h2>
            <p>Its amazing to me how our viewpoint does not always reflect any kind of absolute reality.    What we are seeing, experiencing in the same situation can be drastically different than what a friend, relative, or partner is.

                Consider trying to take a picture of the someone standing in front of sunset.   They are likely barely visible in image because the brilliant sun behind them is providing such harsh backlight.   But step around your subject, with YOUR back to the sun and suddenly they are perfectly lit and you have a shot worthy of framing.  The subject hasnt moved or changed, but your perspective has.  You take a radically different picture.
                
                I was reminded of the importance of frame of reference this week.    I was heading back up to Tahoe for the weekend and got caught in nightmarish traffic due to accidents.   After 7 hours, I was still only to Sacramento and it was getting late, so I decided to call it quits at a friends house in Eldorado Hills just past the capitol city.</p>
